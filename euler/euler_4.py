Problem 4: Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.

    that even number of digits palindromes are divisible by 11. Googling, this is so.
    Decided to only look for products that start and end with 9. This is reflected in
